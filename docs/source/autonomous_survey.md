## SAE Autonomy Levels

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has established a widely accepted standard for defining levels of driving automation. The SAE J3016 standard defines six levels of driving automation, from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation).

![SAE J3016 Levels of Driving Automation](https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/gallery/cm/content/news/sae-blog/j3016graphic_2021.png)

### NHTSA vs SAE Standards Comparison

While SAE J3016 is the industry standard, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has its own regulatory framework for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Here's how they compare:

| Aspect | SAE J3016 | NHTSA |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Scope** | Levels 0-5 (comprehensive taxonomy) | Focuses on Levels 3-5 (ADS only) |
| **Level 2** | Included in classification | Excluded from ADS guidance |
| **Terminology** | "Automated Vehicles" | "Automated Driving Systems (ADS)" |
| **Purpose** | Technical classification standard | Regulatory guidance and safety framework |
| **Focus** | System capabilities and human involvement | Safety assessment and regulatory compliance |
| **Application** | Global industry standard | US regulatory framework |

**Key Differences:**
- **NHTSA's Voluntary Guidance** focuses specifically on SAE Levels 3-5, where the system takes full control of the vehicle including environmental monitoring
- **SAE J3016** provides a comprehensive taxonomy covering all automation levels from 0-5
- NHTSA emphasizes safety self-assessment and performance-based outcomes rather than prescriptive requirements
- SAE standard is technology-focused, while NHTSA guidance is regulation and safety-focused

### Level 2 (Partial Automation)

SAE Level 2 represents partial automation where the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration simultaneously, but the human driver must remain engaged and monitor the driving environment at all times. Key characteristics include:

- **Driver Responsibility**: Driver must keep hands on wheel and eyes on road at all times
- **Continuous Supervision**: Driver is responsible for monitoring the environment and taking immediate control
- **Combined Functions**: System can handle steering AND acceleration/braking together
- **No Legal Disengagement**: Driver cannot legally divert attention from driving tasks
- **Fallback Responsibility**: Driver is the fallback for all driving situations

**Examples**: Tesla Autopilot/FSD, GM Super Cruise, Ford BlueCruise, Mercedes-Benz Driver Assistance Package

### Level 3 (Conditional Automation)

SAE Level 3 represents conditional automation where the vehicle can perform all driving tasks under specific conditions, but the human driver must be ready to take control when requested <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot" index="1">1</mcreference>. Key characteristics include:

- **Driver Responsibility**: Driver can legally take eyes off the road but must remain alert
- **Operational Domain**: Limited to specific conditions (highways, traffic jams, mapped areas)
- **Speed Limitations**: Typically operates under 40-60 mph
- **Takeover Requirement**: Driver must resume control within seconds when prompted

### Key Differences Between Level 2 and Level 3

The transition from Level 2 to Level 3 represents a **fundamental shift in responsibility** and legal liability:

| Aspect | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Driver Attention** | Must monitor environment continuously | Can divert attention under specific conditions |
| **Legal Responsibility** | Driver responsible for all driving tasks | System responsible during automated mode |
| **Hands-on Requirement** | Hands on wheel required | Hands-free operation allowed |
| **Eyes-on-Road** | Eyes must remain on road | Eyes can be diverted (reading, phone use) |
| **Fallback Responsibility** | Driver is always the fallback | System handles fallback within ODD |
| **Regulatory Approval** | Minimal regulatory oversight | Requires extensive certification and approval |

### Why Most Cars (Including Tesla) Remain at Level 2

Despite advanced capabilities, most manufacturers including Tesla maintain Level 2 classification due to several critical factors:

#### **1. Regulatory and Legal Challenges**
- **Liability Concerns**: Level 3 requires manufacturers to accept legal responsibility for accidents during automated mode
- **Certification Requirements**: Extensive testing and regulatory approval processes involving multiple organizations:
  - **SAE International**: Defines the J3016 standard for automation levels
  - **NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)**: US federal safety standards and approval
  - **FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards)**: Compliance requirements for vehicle safety
  - **State DMVs**: Individual state permits for testing and deployment (California DMV, Nevada DMV, etc.)
  - **ISO 26262**: Functional safety standard for automotive systems
  - **UN-ECE WP.29**: Global technical regulations for automated driving systems
  - **TÜV and other certification bodies**: Third-party testing and validation
  - **Example**: Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot required 3+ years of development, extensive real-world testing, and approval from German KBA (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt) and US NHTSA before certification
- **Insurance Implications**: Complex insurance frameworks needed for shared liability models

#### **2. Technical Limitations**
- **Edge Case Handling**: Systems struggle with unpredictable scenarios (construction zones, emergency vehicles, unusual weather)
- **Sensor Reliability**: Current sensor technology has limitations in adverse conditions
- **Geographic Constraints**: Level 3 systems require detailed mapping and infrastructure support

#### **3. Human-Machine Interface Challenges**
- **Takeover Time**: Ensuring drivers can resume control quickly enough when system reaches its limits
- **Attention Management**: Difficulty in keeping drivers alert during automated periods
- **Trust Calibration**: Balancing user confidence without over-reliance on the system

#### **4. Business and Strategic Considerations**
- **Cost vs. Benefit**: Level 3 certification costs may not justify limited operational domains
- **Market Positioning**: Some manufacturers prefer "advanced Level 2" marketing over restricted Level 3
- **Gradual Deployment**: Incremental improvement strategy rather than revolutionary jumps

#### **Tesla's Specific Case**
- **"Full Self-Driving" Branding**: Despite the name, Tesla FSD remains Level 2 requiring constant supervision
- **Beta Testing Approach**: Tesla uses customer fleet for real-world testing rather than controlled certification
- **Regulatory Strategy**: Avoiding formal Level 3 certification while continuously improving capabilities
- **Liability Model**: Maintaining driver responsibility reduces legal exposure

### Level 4 (High Automation)

Level 4 systems can handle all driving tasks within their operational design domain without human intervention <mcreference link="https://www.wired.com/story/chinas-best-self-driving-car-platforms-tested-and-compared-xpeng-nio-li-auto/" index="2">2</mcreference>. Features include:

- **Full Autonomy**: Within specific geographic areas or conditions
- **No Human Intervention**: Required during normal operation
- **Fallback Capability**: System can safely stop if conditions exceed capabilities
- **Commercial Applications**: Robotaxis, delivery vehicles in defined areas

### Level 5 (Full Automation)

Level 5 represents complete autonomy under all conditions that a human driver could handle. **No current system has achieved SAE Level 5** <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot" index="1">1</mcreference>.
